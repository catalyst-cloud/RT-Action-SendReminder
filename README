NAME
    RT::Action::SendReminder - Send a reminder, but don't update LastUpdated

DESCRIPTION
    An Action which can be used from an external tool, or in any situation
    where a ticket transaction has not been started, to send a reminder
    about a ticket, but not change the LastUpdated value.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.4.x and above.

SYNOPSIS
        my $action_obj = RT::Action::SendReminder->new(
            'TicketObj'   => $ticket_obj,
            'TemplateObj' => $template_obj,
        );
        my $result = $action_obj->Prepare();
        $action_obj->Commit() if $result;

METHODS
  Prepare
    Check for the existence of a Transaction. If a Transaction already
    exists, and is of type "Comment" or "Correspond", abort because that
    will give us a loop.

  Commit
    Create a Transaction by calling the ticket's Correspond method on our
    parsed Template, which may have an RT-Send-Cc or RT-Send-Bcc header. The
    Transaction will be of type Correspond. This Transaction can then be
    used by the scrips that actually send the email.
